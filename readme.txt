== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is EzDeFi? How does it work? How can I pay or receive cryptocurrency payment? =

EzDeFi is a payment gateway that helps merchants worldwide accept cryptocurrency payments in a fully decentralized way.

How this works

* When you want to pay a merchant, we will display instructions on how to send funds directly to this merchant through a QR code.
* After a valid payment is confirmed, we will notify the merchant so they can take any necessary actions on their end.

All payments facilitated by ezDeFi are fully decentralized and peer-to-peer. This means that the cryptocurrency goes directly from your wallet to a wallet that is only accessible by the merchant. At no point in this flow does anyone except the merchant, including ezDeFi, have access to these funds.

= How do I get a refund? Can ezDeFi help me with this? =

Because ezDeFi doesn’t keep merchant’s private key, if you would like a refund, please contact the merchant directly.

All transactions made with cryptocurrency are direct peer-to-peer payments from the customer to the merchant. This means that once a payment is sent, there is no way for ezDeFi to reverse the transaction or reclaim funds on your behalf. As a result we are unable to resolve any payment disputes as the transactions are secured by the blockchain and are irreversible.

= I haven’t received the item I purchased. What can I do? =

Please reach out to the merchant directly regarding any issues with your order or an update on your order status.
